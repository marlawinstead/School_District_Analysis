# School_District_Analysis
Using Jupyter Notebook to analyze school district data

Overview

The purpose of this project is to help a data scientist with analyzing data collected from schools in a city district. The data collected is on student funding and standardized test scores. In this analysis, we will be reviewing performance trends and patterns based on the data collected. The goal is to report those trends to the school to board to help with decisions made about the budgets for each school. We will also specifically be reviewing data on 9th graders from Thomas High School, who have been suspected of cheating on their tests.

Results

How is the district summary affected?

How is the school summary affected?

Removing the 9th grade students from the dataset dropped the overall passing percentage by 26%. The original analysis was 91%, whereas the adjusted analysis shows 65%, as demonstrated below.

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Thomas High School was initially ranked 2nd place in the district based on standardized test scores. After adjusting the dataset to eliminate the 9th grade scores, Thomas High School is shown as ranking 8th.

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

-Math and reading scores by grade

-Scores by school spending

-Scores by school size

-Scores by school type
