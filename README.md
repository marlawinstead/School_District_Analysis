# School_District_Analysis
Using Jupyter Notebook to analyze school district data

Overview

The purpose of this project is to help a data scientist with analyzing data collected from schools in a city district. The data collected is on student funding and standardized test scores. In this analysis, we will be reviewing performance trends and patterns based on the data collected. The goal is to report those trends to the school to board to help with decisions made about the budgets for each school. We will also specifically be reviewing data on 9th graders from Thomas High School, who have been suspected of cheating on their tests.
